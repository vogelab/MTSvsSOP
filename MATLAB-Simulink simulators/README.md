Folder content
=
- "Base models" folder.
It contains 10 files with *.slx extension. These files correspond to the  actual models.

- Figures.
14 files with *.mldatx extension. These files correspond to the experimental designs of each figure (Figure 15 and 16 use 4 designs, one for each simulated experiment). Can be opened only if "Base models" is the Current folder in MATLAB.


How to run the simulations and visualize data for each figure?
=

1. Download "Base models" folder and all the figures you want to check.

2. Open MATLAB.

3. Make "Base models" your Current folder in MATLAB.

4. Open the figure you want to look at. Simulink will be open.

5. Click Run All.

6. Visualize data by clicking on Data Inspector.


NOTES
=
The figures 07-08, 9, 12 and 13 compute pd2 (SOP) and lambda b (MTS feedback) with a r parameter to facilitate the simulations of figures 15-16. This doesn't affect the results.
