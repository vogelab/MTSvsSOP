- NO DOWLOAD MTSvsSOP.ipynb: The same notebook described above, except that it is intended to run on Google Colab (no dowload required).
- MTSvsSOP.py: This file is a Python script that contains the models themselves. Also, contains two other functions to generate trials and tests.
- miscellaneous_functions.py: This file is a Python script that contains functions that plot the figures and others that help the analytical work of each one. In addition, it contains the empirical data used.

How to run the simulations?
